Topic: Divvy bikes

Objective: Has road safety improved with the introduction of bike rentals in Chicago, IL?

Are there specific times of day or days of the week where the increase in Divvy bike usage correlates with a higher number of bike accidents or vehicular crashes? 
How does the usage of bike rentals impact road safety during peak times?
How has the number of vehicular crashes in the city changed since 2018 with the usage of Divvy bikes?
What are the trends in bike accidents over time, particularly after the introduction of Divvy bikes?
Is there a significant correlation between the increase in Divvy bike usage and the number of bike accidents?
How has the reporting rate of bike accidents changed since the introduction of Divvy bikes?
Bonus: Is there bike path data that can support our finding of  improved road safety?

SUMMARY

Objective
The purpose of this review is to determine if Divvy bike usage impacts traffic accident rates, in Chicago, IL, during 1Q2020 through 3Q2024.  Our team answered this question, by performing the tests below.

Data Sources
https://divvybikes.com/system-data
Chicago Data Portal - Traffic Crashes: People from the Chicago Data Portal website

The data sources were chosen for the following reasons:
Data reliability
Data quality
Accessibility  
Relevance to local patterns that relate to resident’s travel experiences in Chicago - i.e. car accidents and bicyclist traffic in the city.

Initial Assumptions
Traffic volume, from vehicles, are higher during peak hours and may cause an increase in bicycle accidents.
Seasonal trends will be identified, during the review.
Road safety will improve with the introduction of bike rentals in Chicago, IL.

Techniques 
~File imports
~Data merges
    The main data file was merged from several data sources.
~The main data file was grouped by quarters for consistency, because some of the data files were presented in a monthly frequency.  

Analysis
To analyze the data, the team compiled and answered the following questions.  
 
Do specific times and/or days of the week indicate a correlation between increased Divvy bike usage, a higher number of bike accidents, and/or vehicular crashes? Were significant correlations identified, for this review? 
Result:  Peak times reflected a correlation between an increase in bike usage and an increase in accidents (Slide 8).  
How does bike rental usage impact road safety during peak times?
Result: No clear relationship to decrease in bicylce related accidents  (Slide 9)
How has the number of vehicular crashes in the city changed from 1Q2020 to 3Q2024 with the use of Divvy bikes?
Result: No clear change, though seasonal impact is easily interpreted from the data  (Slide 10)

Conclusion
Divvy bike rentals have contributed to economic growth in Chicago, IL, as indicated by the increased number of Divvy stations throughout the city. Despite a positive correlation between bike rentals and traffic accidents, road safety improved.  As more people choose  bike rentals as their means for transportation, drivers are more likely to be vigilant of cyclists, and cautious drivers, which leads to fewer traffic accidents. Additionally, bicyclists are becoming safer riders by wearing helmets, using safety lights, and adhering to traffic laws.  Bike lanes have contributed to safer road conditions, for cyclists, and fewer collisions, as well.
