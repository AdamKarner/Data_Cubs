Repository for Data Cubs Project 1 
Objective
The purpose of this review is to determine if Divvy bike usage impacts traffic accident rates, in Chicago, IL, during 1Q2020 through 3Q2024.  Our team answered this question, by performing the tests below.

Data Sources
https://divvybikes.com/system-data
Chicago Data Portal - Traffic Crashes: People from the Chicago Data Portal website

The data sources were chosen for the following reasons:
Data reliability
Data quality
Accessibility  
Relevance to local patterns that relate to residentâ€™s travel experiences in Chicago - i.e. car accidents and bicyclist traffic in the city.

Initial Assumptions
Traffic volume, from vehicles, are higher during peak hours and may cause an increase in bicycle accidents.
Seasonal trends will be identified, during the review.
Road safety will improve with the introduction of bike rentals in Chicago, IL.

Techniques 
File imports
Data merges
The main data file was merged from several data sources.
The main data file was grouped by quarters for consistency, because some of the data files were presented in a monthly frequency.  

Analysis
To analyze the data, the team compiled and answered the following questions.  
 
Do specific times and/or days of the week indicate a correlation between increased Divvy bike usage, a higher number of bike accidents, and/or vehicular crashes? Were significant correlations identified, for this review? 
Result:  Peak times reflected a correlation between an increase in bike usage and an increase in accidents (Slide 3).  
How does bike rental usage impact road safety during peak times?

How has the number of vehicular crashes in the city changed from 1Q2020 to 3Q2024 with the use of Divvy bikes?

Bonus: Is there bike path data that can support our finding of  improved road safety?

Conclusion
Divvy bike rentals have contributed to economic growth in Chicago, IL, as indicated by the increased number of Divvy stations throughout the city. Despite a positive correlation between bike rentals and traffic accidents, road safety improved.  As more people choose  bike rentals as their means for transportation, drivers are more likely to be vigilant of cyclists, and cautious drivers, which leads to fewer traffic accidents. Additionally, bicyclists are becoming safer riders by wearing helmets, using safety lights, and adhering to traffic laws.  Bike lanes have contributed to safer road conditions, for cyclists, and fewer collisions, as well.
